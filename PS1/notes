Conditionals

Creating your own parity function
    essentially defining your own function (i.e. is_even() ) to use within an if statement:
                if is_even(x) :

Pythonic programming
    aka, ways of programming that are only ever really seen in python
    i.e. 'return True if n%2 == 0 else False'
        although the above can be simplified to:
            return n%2 == 0
            where the program will evaluate what is happening within the n%2==0 as either true or false

match statements
    can be used to map things to another (essentially a switch case statement)
        match name:
          case "Harry" | "Hermione" | "Ron":
              print("Gryffindor")
          case "Draco":
              print("Slytherin")
          case _:
              print("Who?")
    '_' will match any input (essentially default)
