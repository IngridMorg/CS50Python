The documentation of the print() function includes end='\n', this is why the print statement always adds a newline at
the ends. It is also why we can change this to be a different value by doing something like
        print("hello", end="")

print(f"hello, {name}")
    a special way to print with strings, essentially adds string formatting.

String Functions
    strip()  -  remove whitespace that may have been added before or after a user's input
    title()  -  capitalise the first letter of every word in a string

Non-string input
    x = int(input("Enter a number: ")  -  automatically cast the string input to an integer
        same goes for floats

Float formatting
   What if we want to print 1000 as 1,000?
    print(f"{z:,}") where z = 1000
        this command means that the output will include the desired commas where necessary
    print(f"{z:.2f}") rounds down to the nearest 2 decimal points
        long(er) winded version: z = round(x / y, 2)

Functions
    we can default output to functions by assigning a value in the parameters, that will be overwritten if when the
    function is called a different value is passed. i.e.
                                                        def hello(to= "world"):
                                                            print("Hello", to)
